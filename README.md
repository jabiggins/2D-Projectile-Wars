# 2D-Projectile-Wars
A local multiplayer 2D game created in Visual Studio in C#

The first programming project that I created (Sophmore year of high school, spring 2015). Essentially I construct a 4 player multiplayer
game where players shoot projectiles at their opponenets. This is run nativly in Visual Studio.
